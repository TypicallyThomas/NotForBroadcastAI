# NotForBroadcastAI
A bot/AI agent to play Not for Broadcast. This project was developed based on tutorials from [Ben Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1m2M8LQlzfKtkKq2lK5xko4X-8EZzFPI) and [sentdex](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeETZEOy4VdocT7TOjfSA8a). This project is currently under development and is welcoming community input. Feel free to make a pull request if you'd like to help make this project a reality.

## Resolution
Important to note is that this program was made with a smaller Not for Broadcast window, with resolution set at 1176x662@60. This is to allow Python to take screenshots, since it does not work with the game minimised. This is a sad limitation to how we're taking the screenshots.

## Settings
In order to make the bot recognize vision mixer's indicator color more easily, okay shots' indicator color needed to be changed from yellow to blue.

# Help required
Right now, there's a few issues with this program that need addressing. There's a few TODO's in the scripts, but if you spot any issues in the program you'd like to have a go at fixing, feel free to make a pull request.
